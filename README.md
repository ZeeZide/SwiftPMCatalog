This repository contains the meta data driving the
[SwiftPM Catalog](https://zeezide.com/en/products/swiftpmcatalog/index.html)
macOS application.
It enhances the search data provided by the
excellent
[SwiftPM Library](https://github.com/daveverwer/SwiftPMLibrary)
with categorization information, in addition to some extra meta data.

## Pull Requests Welcome!

If you'd like to add icons or snapshots, rearrange or promote
certain packages in a section, feel free to submit a pull request.

Before submitting, please make sure the JSON is valid, e.g. using:
```shell
jq -e . packages.json > /dev/null
```

### Testing

You can test changes by setting the `CatalogInfoURL` user default.
The default's default is this URL of this repo:
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZeeZide/SwiftPMCatalog/master/catalog-info.json`.
Buut you can point it to any location you like.

E.g. `defaults write NSGlobalDomain CatalogInfoURL "http://myserver/catalog-info.plist"`, or start the app on the commandline
with the `-CatalogInfoURL "http://myserver/catalog-info.plist"` argument.

> Note: When icons are from a resizable source, we prefer the 256x256 images.

## Catalog JSON Format

The main catalog content is a set of "sections" shown in the sidebar.
Those can have "subsections" and "content". 
The "content" is again an array of different content types (currently two
kinds of lists).

### Sections

Sections are stored under the "sidebar" key, they have:

- a "title"
- (currently) a static "image" (e.g. "ImDiscover") stored in the asset catalog 
  of the application
- a "Content" array
- optionally "subsections"

Example:
```json
{ "title": "Wanderlust",
  "image": "ImDiscover",
  "content": [
    {
      "title"  : "All Things Swift",
      "type"   : "small-list",
      "needle" : "swift",
      "rows"   : 2
    }
  ]
}
```

### Content

Currently there are two types of content:

- "small-list"
- "snapshot-list"

Small lists can be driven by either a 
[SwiftPM Library](https://github.com/daveverwer/SwiftPMLibrary)
query,
or by a static set of repository URLs.

"snapshot-lists" are always backed by repository URLs.

Sample small query list:
```json
{
  "title"  : "All Things Swift",
  "type"   : "small-list",
  "needle" : "swift",
  "rows"   : 2
}
```

Sample snapshot list:
```json
{
  "type": "snapshot-list",
  "title": "Big ones",
  "repositories": [
    "https://github.com/swiftwebui/SwiftWebUI.git",
    "https://github.com/mxcl/PromiseKit.git"
  ]
}
```


### Overriding Images

Using the catalog you can override default images generated by the application.

#### Icons

Note: When icons are from a resizable source, we prefer the 256x256 images.

Would be nice to have better auto icon lookup, but right now you can override
icons.

```json
"icons": {
  "https://github.com/SnapKit/SnapKit.git": 
    "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7809696?s=256&v=4"
}
```

#### Snapshot Images

By default snapshots are generated by snapshotting the repository web page.
But you can also provide a nicer, more descriptive image. Which can even
point to an animated GIF.

Note: Images a preferable at 1.6x scale (e.g. 640x400).

Example:
```json
  "snapshot-images": {
    "https://github.com/swiftwebui/SwiftWebUI.git": 
      "http://www.alwaysrightinstitute.com/images/swiftwebui/AvocadoCounter/AvocadoCounter.gif"
  }
```
